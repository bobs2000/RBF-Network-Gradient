#A Modified RBF Network Implementation 
-----

![RBF Implementation](/images/network.png)




RBF networks are unique networks from standard MLP models. There are a handful of implementations. I wrote this implementation where each neuron is optimized by gradient descent. 

With this implementation you are able to generate a set of RBF neurons with it's own central basis vector. You are also able to train subsets of neurons on your own choice of data. 

See the Jupyter Notebook for implementation. 


To do: 
- [x] Write notebook to demonstrate basic implementation of RBF network.
- [ ] Notebook to demonstrate training multiple sets of RBF neurons on multiple types of data
- [ ] Notebook to demonstrate gradient ascent training.
